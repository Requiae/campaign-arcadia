## Day 1.

Cast off at Limani

## Day 7

After sailing along the coast for a week we are now entering the open ocean.

## Day 22

Feast of light

## Day 28

We arrived on the small island of Pai’na today. The church arranged for a resupply and lodgings for the night. This will be the last batch of fresh food before we arrive on Arcadia.

## Day 46

Feast of light

## Day 70 (start of campaign)

We neared the island of Arcadia , celebrating the Feast of Light on board. Feast was less abundant than hoped. Captain Kingsley suggested landing at the River delta on the north side of the Island.

## Day 71

Bad storm today. half the ship is gone, turned what is left into temporary lodging and foraged for additional supplies to make up for what we lost. Leonid and Maya got hit hard, are currently recovering. Found some of the gone ship, used to repair what we could of the ship. tomorrow expeditionary party will visit nearby village to initiate contact and trade whilst the others attempts to further secure our new base.

## Day 72

After decent night rest we marched further inland towards the wormwood, to the hamlet of hamlet. the people here feel off, and all resources are brought by forest people who sound like fey. Met a crew member of the HLS starseeker, alfred, who seems to have lost some memories (in his diary too). Crew improved shelter and hunted crabs. Bill and Amelia noted a small patrol of frogmen, who live in a nearby town.

## Day 73

Today part of the group has set out for a town to the east of the landing site.
This town is called Rana and mostly populated by frogmen and fishmen
As soon as they entered the city the party felt uneasy. We were escorted throughout the town and many remarks were made and answers given that gave the impression not all was as pristine as it appeared.
After scouring the markets for tools and such that needed to be replenished (and being ripped off in a way that made us spend regular price) we went through the harbour, where the conflict with goblinkind was visible.
It seems a group of goblins with explosive and flight capabilities has been raiding this town and its agglomeration for a long time.
Murray has sent his pet familiar on an exploration mission of its own to observe the parts of the town they would prefer we remain oblivious about.
We visited the local temple and its archpriest Iploosh. Based on the conversation there (some of which was not for our ears) and the familiar’s report we have deducted that these people use tricks similar to the fey to bend the mind of humans and turn them into slavery.
Hopefully averting a tracking attempt we returned to base to weather an incoming storm

## Day 74
