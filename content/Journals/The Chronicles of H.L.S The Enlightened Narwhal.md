## Day 1: (3-5)

Cast off at Limani.

## Day 7: (9-5)

After sailing along the coast for a week we are now entering the open ocean.

## Day 22: (24-5)

Feast of light.

## Day 28: (6-6)

We arrived on the small island of Pai’na today. The church arranged for a resupply and lodgings for the night. This will be the last batch of fresh food before we arrive on [[The Island|Arcadia]].

## Day 46: (24-6)

Flower Festival.

## Day 70: (24-7) (start of campaign)

We neared the [[The Island|island of Arcadia]], celebrating the Feast of Light on board. Feast was less abundant than hoped. [[Kingsley|Captain Kingsley]] suggested landing at the River delta on the north side of the Island.

## Day 71: (1-8)

Bad storm today. half the ship is gone, turned what is left into temporary lodging and foraged for additional supplies to make up for what we lost. [[Leonid]] and [[Maya]] got hit hard, and are currently recovering. Found some of the gone ship, used to repair what we could of the ship. Tomorrow an expeditionary party will visit the nearby village to initiate contact and trade whilst the others attempt to further secure our new base.

## Day 72: (2-8)

After a decent night's rest we marched further inland towards the wormwood, to the [[Hamlet|hamlet of Hamlet]]. The people here feel off, and all resources are brought by forest people who sound like fey. Met a crew member of the HLS starseeker, [[Alfred]], who seems to have lost some memories (in his diary too). Crew improved shelter and hunted crabs. [[William|Bill]] and [[Amelia]] noted a small patrol of frogmen, who live in a nearby town.

## Day 73: (3-8)

Today part of the group has set out for a town to the east of the landing site.
This town is called Rana and mostly populated by frogmen and fishmen.
As soon as they entered the city the party felt uneasy. We were escorted throughout the town and many remarks were made and answers given that gave the impression not all was as pristine as it appeared.
After scouring the markets for tools and such that needed to be replenished (and being ripped off in a way that made us spend regular price) we went through the harbour, where the conflict with goblinkind was visible.
It seems a group of goblins with explosive and flight capabilities has been raiding this town and its agglomeration for a long time.
[[Murrey]] has sent his pet familiar on an exploration mission of its own to observe the parts of the town they would prefer we remain oblivious about.
We visited the local temple and its [[Iploosh|Archpriest Iploosh]]. Based on the conversation there (some of which was not for our ears) and the familiar’s report we have deduced that these people use tricks similar to the fey to bend the mind of humans and turn them into slavery.
Hopefully averting a tracking attempt we returned to base to weather an incoming storm.

## Day 74: (4-8)

Faced with a potential enemy near our temporary base we have decided to form a caravan and move to a new location as a group. Three of us would move into the warmwood to scout out a safe path whilst the others escorted the caravan to the [[Hamlet|hamlet of Hamlet]].
The scouting party decided to move towards a tree explicitly marked on the map first. halfway through the journey they set up camp. They were surrounded by a fey circle of mushrooms during the night but quickly broke this circle allowing for an uneventful night.

## Day 75: (5-8)

Whilst the caravan waited near the [[Hamlet]], the scouting party managed to find the marked tree. They found that this tree was in fact the fey governing this forest together with a three headed council. Further queries revealed that they did not mentally alter those in the hamlet or anywhere else on the island. The true culprit was the island itself. It seems those not from the island will slowly have their mental capacity degrade with each new moon, entering a full breakdown of memories around the end of the seventh cycle. There is much unknown around this curse, including where it comes from and if those affected will continue to degrade after leaving the island. For this reason our best course of action is to further investigate this phenomenon and attempt to halt or even reverse its effects.

After finishing our conversation with the forest council we investigated a ruin we chanced upon earlier. We found it was a high tech picnic location built in an earlier age, but with technology that seems to surpass our own. On this site we found what used to be a map, with one location still discernible. Further investigation will be done in the near future.

Whilst the scouting party was on its way back the people of [[Rana]] made a move against the caravan in the hamlet. Fortunately the scouting party came back as full scale combat started and together the team managed to eliminate the kidnappers. None of the team has taken significant wounds and after spending the night in the hamlet we shall move through the forest.

## Day 76: (6-8)

The team has decided to investigate the location marked by the ancient ruins as they move through the forest. While travelling we entered a [[DementiaTown|small town]] with a large group of both fey and curse victims. These victims appear to be in the later stages of the curse. Whilst scouring the town for info and supplies we met an anthropomorphic dog by the name of [[Bjork]]. During the conversation it became clear that the island's locals do not dream, or at least not to the degree and effect people from Lux do. It is possible dreams and dementia might be related on this island.

The next [[CorpseProcessing|location]] we visited appears to be where those who passed away are processed by fungi. After quickly asking for directions we sent the caravan back to the previous town and started our investigation of the cave. It is an ancient underground ruin.
Although proper investigation was made difficult by the dark, it appears to be an underground train station. It even included a map activated through divination magic and a (deactivated) iron golem as clerk. Unfortunately one side was closed off, likely because something made the rail unsafe before abandonment, and the other side appears to lead to the city of [[Rana]]. Although we shall travel on foot for now, travelling through a train network appears to be possible. After rejoining the caravan at the town and spending the night there we shall continue our travels.
