## Year 3366

### 4th Moon

> [!note]+ 21st
> [[Sahiusa]], [[Hanford]], and I finally arrived at Limani.
> I’m looking forward to sleeping in an actual bed tonight.

> [!note]+ 22nd
> The bed was great.
> [[Sahiusa]] met with the Church’s delegation today so I got to wander around Limani. The streets were busy and it kind of scared me. Even still, I went out and bought some new cartographer tools for the days ahead.

> [!note]+ 23rd
> Another day that [[Sahiusa]] was in meetings, there was little I could do so aside from a small stroll I mostly stayed inside.

> [!note]+ 24th - Feast of Light
> Today we attended the Feast hosted by the Church. I got a fair share of odd stares. I did get to meet the rest of the crew during the Feast, it’s an odd bunch, but I think I could enjoy their company.

### 5th Moon

> [!note]+ 1st
> Now that I was officially introduced to the crew as their healer I was allowed to enter the ship. The ship was mostly prepared and all that was left for me to do was to prepare my own cabin and ensure that the medical gear was complete.

> [!note]+ 2nd
> [[Maya]] asked me about my eating habits, apparently because she is curious about dragons, which reminded me that I should stack up on nibbles. I won’t be able to find any quartz on the seas and I’m sure to go insane eating only canned food and fish…

> [!note]+ 3rd - First day of the expedition
> Early in the morning we cast off. I had to take the animals onboard but after that I was free of duties for the time being. I was quite excited to be on a ship so I mostly loafed around on the deck.

> [!note]+ 4th
> The day was slow. We’ll be sailing along the coast for the next few days. Hearing the seagulls bicker is quite fun.

> [!note]+ 6th
> I’m starting to get bored. Most of my time is spent singing, watching the sailors of the crew do their thing, tending to the animals, and being questioned by [[Maya]]. But I guess it’s a good thing when a healer has little to do.

> [!note]+ 9th
> [[Sahiusa]] told me that we’ll be entering the open ocean today.

> [!note]+ 24th - Feast of Light
> A Feast on the open ocean. That means a whole two cans and a fish per person, what a meal. [[Sahiusa]] admonished me for being grumpy during dinner.

### 6th Moon

> [!note]+ 6th
> Today we arrived on the island of Pai’na. We got to resupply and sleep on solid land tonight. Tomorrow we will resume the journey and we’ll have no more stops until [[The Island|Arcadia]] itself. I’m just happy to stretch my legs and run around a bit.

> [!note]+ 7th
> Off we go again. The island food was strangely spicy, I kind of liked it. Their fruits however are only slightly better than fish, they're too sour for my tastes.

> [!note]+ 24th - Flower Festival
> I’m starting to get sick of fish. Honestly looking forward to the Fast since then our meals won’t include fish. Anyhow, the festival itself was fun, even without the flowers. We danced and sang a lot.

### 7th Moon

> [!note]+ 12th - Fast
> I managed to convince [[Murrey]], our cook, to let me have half a can of pickles and half a can of peaches for dinner under the guise of not feeling well. Somehow I doubt my sister will be happy with this.

> [!note]+ 24th - Feast of Light
> Today is the 70th day of the expedition already. We should arrive at [[The Island|Arcadia]] tomorrow. Sadly we weren’t able to celebrate the Feast with fresh food today, so more fish was consumed. [[Kingsley|Captain Kingsley]] said we’d land at the delta on the north side of the island. Soon we can stop eating fish.

### 8th Moon - Start of the campaign

> [!note]+ 1st
> We got caught in a bad storm today. Half of the ship is gone, and what was left was turned into a shelter. We stranded a fair bit west of where we had intended to land. After I recovered from my initial shock I tended to both [[Maya]] and [[Leonid]] who got wounded while trying to bring the ship back under control.

> [!note]+ 2nd
> Today we left camp and headed west towards the Warmwood as our maps told us there would be a [[Hamlet|small village]] there. Strangely enough the sheep here are more lucid than the people. Only a man named [[Alfred]] from a previous expedition was still able to communicate with us, and he could barely remember anything from the day before. It seems these people are fed by fey from the woods, almost as if they are cattle. I don’t like it here. We opted not to take any food given by the fey with us and harvested some berries ourselves before heading back to camp.

> [!note]+ 3rd
> This day we headed east, towards the town of [[Rana]] populated mostly by frogmen and fishfolk. We were almost immediately given an escort and only shown around the good parts of town. A few comments were made here and there and it quickly became clear that there was something they were not telling us. Anyhow, we were here for tools and while they were clearly trying to rip us off, we ended up paying the normal price for them. Our escort really wanted to show us their temple so we went to the destroyed harbour, apparently the goblins down south are pirates and like to play with explosives.
>
> At this point [[Murrey]] sent Mort to investigate the town, something felt horribly awry. At the temple we met [[Iploosh|Archpriest Iploosh]] who accidentally ended up spilling their aim of enslaving people. I got sick and decided to leave quickly. Upon leaving we were given a cart, and once we were no longer visible from town I discovered their goal of tracking us by means of the cart, we sabotaged this plan and took the cart with us.
>
> Unlike my expectations I slept decently well. No nightmares. However there was this odd dream of being a sleeping dragon in some crystal caverns, and there were a bunch of kobolds trying to awaken me. I still remember finding them cute but ultimately being unable to make the slightest movement.

> [!note]+ 4th
> We discussed our plans and decided to move camp, the fishy assholes would soon come to find us. The scouting party went ahead to the Warmwood to seek a specific tree for [[Murrey]]. We expect to find it tomorrow.

> [!note]+ 5th
> We found the tree that [[Murrey]] was looking for. Apparently his fey patron told him to deliver a letter. It’s clear we should keep this from [[Kingsley|Captain Kingsley]] and [[Amelia]]. Should not be a big issue, I have my fair share of secrets from the Church too.
> After talking to the [[Mother|Mother tree]] we were given safe passage through the woods, and we learned that the people degrading is not the fey’s doing, instead it seems to be an effect the island has on anybody not from the island. It happens in stages, with every stage progressing every new moon, the seventh being the last. I already regret letting [[Sahiusa]] go on this expedition, we should have stayed home.
>
> Aside from the depressing news of our serious time limit, we did find some ruins from the Arcadians. Even though it was just a picnic place, it also included a map. We’ll investigate the ruins the map pointed to tomorrow. After heading back to our meetup point in the hamlet we fought with the fishy bastards. I never liked seeing Sahiusa fight, but she can hold her own, even if she did end up rolling in the mud today.

> [!note]+ 6th
> Today we decided to investigate the location marked on the map I found. On our way to said ruins we passed by a [[DementiaTown|small town]] inhabited by fey and people from Lux. The people from Lux either are in a later stage of the curse or just very late in life. Personally I didn’t like to linger here, I’d prefer to get rid of the curse as soon as possible, however the group decided to take a break here and convinced me to play some music together with the fey. During our conversations with an awakened dog by the name of [[Bjork]] we did learn that the inhabitants of this island do not dream. I fear that the curse and dream are linked, and I do not like my odds as someone who is ‘Dream Ascended’.
>
> The next [[CorpseProcessing|village]] we passed was the place where the dead are processed, as per their agreement with the fey. We did not linger and after asking for directions we headed straight for the ruins. The ruins seemed to be some [[WarmwoodStation|underground train station]], and a map [[Sahiusa]] activated showed it is even a whole network. Sadly the network is not active at the moment, but we did find a gem that seemed to have powered a golem clerk, so hopefully we can find a charged one soon. For now however we will travel by foot. We are spending the night in the town we met [[Bjork]], and I must admit that the fey do properly care for the cursed.

> [!note]+ 7th
> Today we left the forest, or at least mostly. We came across two defensive outposts. The [[DryadOutpost|first]] was on the dryad's side and was manned by [[Oakleaf|Commander Oakleaf]] who warned us of the goblins and their aggressive nature. The [[GoblinOutpost|latter]] belonging to the goblins who, despite their shoddy common, ended up being quite friendly, albeit very wary of us being spies for the dryads. We ended up being escorted to [[Mosshelm]]. It's quite clear that the town used to belong to the dryads, but it has been fully repurposed to suit the needs of the goblins, and as it happens other little folk that they share the town with. They keep harping on about their freedom but I'm not quite sold that's something given to the cursed. Anyhow, we bartered with a halfling merchant for some canned food for tents and other supplies, and they even build another cart for us.
>
> We found this inn called 'The Grilled Gourd' which seems to be used for new inhabitants before they get a new place, we had to eat our own food though. After dinner we had some drinks with a trader couple who informed us about the plains in the south. There is a trading outpost for the city in the plains which is inhabited by humans and the like, the [[content/Arcadia/Forest of Icycles/index|Forest of Icycles]] is said to be very hostile with the cold and large animals such as dire bears and winter wolves. The mountains near that fortress we want to go to are inhabited by giants, but lower in the mountains there seem to be caves and tunnels that seem to be our size. Tonight we'll have to sleep on our bedrolls though, the beds are significantly to small for us.

> [!note]+ 8th
> It's good to have fully left the forest, but it also means we'll have a harder time gathering resources. On our way to that trading outpost we heard of yesterday we encountered the halfling trader couple from yesterday again at a [[WalledGarden|walled garden]] which was clearly of Arcadian build. We decided to travel together with the couple to the outpost, and on our way it seems [[Murrey]] got a few halfling recipes, I'm curious what they'll be like.
>
> At the outpost we met a elven trader by the name of [[Hamon|Hamon Aeqenmar]] who carried himself like a noble and was accompanied by four cursed. Given the way he carried himself I responded in kind and he was happy to learn we are Luxian and still have our wits about us. It seems he is of Luxian descent, however since he grew up here he is spared the curse and doesn't have dreams. [[Sahiusa]] and I know of house Aeqen, who did join several expeditions, however, so it is very likely his parents were Luxian themselves. A small incident occurred due to my sister's blundering bluntness but he seemed to not be too bothered. After he finished his dealings he invited us into his city, which he claimed himself since he found it abandoned.
>
> Aeqen, as we've come to call it, is guarded by several ancient wards, and Hamon can only pass these given his expertise in the arcane arts. The city itself is also clearly Arcadian and very well maintained, and there are quite a few of those automatons around, a lot of them still functional but many also had their power gems either exhausted or broken. After visiting his house we recharged the gem we had found in the golem at [[WarmwoodStation|Warmwood Station]]. I also could not contain my curiousity, so I tried my hand at one of these broken gems, given the functioning ones are too valuable. I knew rocks could be bland, but this gem tasted stale, it seems the crystal could not withstand a long life of being used to contain magic. Disgusting and not nutritious, somehow it was worse than fish.
>
> Finally we were led to the central tower that likely powered the wards. Hamon was too scared to go in, but that's where we will shine. In discussing our plans going forward we came to an understanding and entered some sort of alliance with Hamon. We were also warned that on the nights of the new moon when the curse progresses our dreams will likely be horrendous and debilitating, Sahiusa and I quickly agreed that I'll sleep in a separate building away from the group that night for obvious reasons, and she'll stay in a building nearby. I'm trying not to think about it as that night draws ever closer. For now I'm waiting for the first group to leave the baths, I'm planning to take a nice long soak and properly clean myself after more than three months of travel.

> [!note]+ 9th
> That bath last night was amazing! It feels great to be clean again, I have learned to enjoy the glimmering of my wings and the luster of the fur on my tail.
