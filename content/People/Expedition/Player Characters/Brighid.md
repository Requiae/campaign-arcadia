## Backstory

Brighid Pavet was born to the loving elven house of Pavet, her father Elduin Pavet the baron of Zenndra. In her early years she and her elder sister [[Sahiusa]] had the energy of a whirlwind and often played pranks on their brother Waris. After she had grown to adolescence it became time to learn how to serve the family. Like many in her family the young elf took interest in the arts, however unlike most of her family she was lacking in martial prowess. Instead she shined where she could use her voice, and thus she was raised as a lady of the court, well versed in the arts of song and politics. Whenever there were no lessons she would, depending on the time of day, observe the knights training in the courtyard, the mountainous landscape, or the stars, losing herself in thought and song.

Her pleasant life was abruptly cut short shortly after her 46th birthday however. Brighid had left the barony to visit a dear friend of hers, but the carriage went missing without a sign of struggle. Even after long and arduous searches aided by the confederate duchies of An Eilbheis and the Church, the Pavets could not find their daughter nor her retainers.

Brighid woke up in a cell in the cellar of a church somewhere in a neighbouring county. The floors and walls of the cellar were covered in distorted religious symbols. There were scriptures singing praise to Ashling scattered around, and there were scriptures cursing her decorating the walls. Brighid's cell was bare safe from a loaf of hard bread and a bowl of water. After being awake for a few hours, four people dressed in religious garments entered the candlelit cellar. Brighid had expected them to explain how she would remain here until her family paid a ransom. However they never spoke a word to her, instead they were chanting eerily. She feared she might be a sacrifice instead, but even that would be kind compared to what they actually had in mind. Confused and scared by the chanting, pain suddenly wrecked her body, and she passed out.

Several years went by. The religious fanatics experimented on Brighid with the power of the dream and various other means. As a result Brighid had changed. Draconic horns adorned her head, wings sprouted from her back, her hands were turned into claws, a tail was wrapped around her as if to protect her, and red gem-like scales covered large parts of her body. Mentally the woman fared not much better; fear occupied most of her mind, she had lost most of her memories and whatever was left was fragmented at best, and every time she slept she was plagued by nightmares. Whenever she tried to beg for release, screeches laced with draconic force came out instead. It took years of experimentation before her draconic powers rose to the level where her captors were unable to approach her safely. Because of the civil war the fanatics would soon need to relocate, and because of her growing power they would rather relocate sooner rather than later. She was drugged and moved to a cave near the county Forind, where her older sister [[Sahiusa]] worked. A scout noticed the new activity and reported it. [[Sahiusa]] came to investigate expecting a rebel outpost, but instead found her long lost sister.

Their reunion was hectic. Brighid heard a lot of noise and shouting outside of her dark cell mere days after she was relocated. After the noise came silence, and after the silence came muffled voices. Then light flooded the cell as the door was opened. Brighid screeched in fear, the draconic force contained within her voice knocking back [[Hanford|one of the figures]] and temporarily stunning the others. Silence filled the cell once more for a few seconds before it was broken by the figure standing in front calling her by her own name. The voice calling out was familiar, but she could not place it. One thing was certain however, this person was not one of her captors, and their voice calmed her mind. She let herself be wrapped in something soft and was carried outside.

The next few weeks were a blur and Brighid had trouble finding her bearings. Her mind was still in tatters and she couldn't understand what people were saying. She recognised the words, but had difficulties assigning meaning to those words. She was moved from place to place as circumstances changed. The only constant was her saviour who had stayed by her side, the person Brighid eventually learned was her older sister. However whenever her sister left for work, the horrific memories of what had happened to her came flooding back. And Brighid in her fear and with her lack of control accidentally let her thunderous power run rampant on multiple such occasions. It was then that she was finally sent back to the barony of Zenndra.

Her family welcomed their 52 year old daughter who no longer remembered them with open arms, regardless of her changed appearance. The days after she was brought back home the volatile half-dragon was slowly nursed back to health. It took months for Brighid to regain her voice, and it took years for her to be able to talk without empowering her words with draconic power. Over the span of more than a decade she slowly learned how to use this power with intentional effects. And while she still was terrified, awkward, and prone to lash out in fear, she did fit in decently well. She especially bonded with [[Sahiusa]] who she viewed as her protector. In time she learned to enjoy the things she did before her whole ordeal. She found peace in the calm of nature, she watched her sister train with the knights, but above all she started to sing again. The issue however were her nightmares. Most nights there were fearful draconic screeches. To prevent rumours from spreading, and to ensure everyone in the estate got their sleep, her bedroom was moved to a heavily guarded house next to the main manor. Brighid herself could never fully remember her nightmares, but a few themes were constant; a rampaging dragon covered in rubies, the death of her elder sister [[Sahiusa]] by said dragon, and [[The Island|an island far to the south]] that might be the key to preventing this future.

Now that [[Sahiusa]] is moving out to [[The Island|Arcadia]] for her own reasons, Brighid chose to accompany her to prevent her nightmares from becoming true, hoping to regain the lost memories of her youth, and wishing to learn how to control the large reservoir of power contained within her.
