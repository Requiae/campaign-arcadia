## Backstory

In the western reaches of Lux lie the confederate duchies of An Eilbheis. which as the name implies is a confederation of the stronger duchies of the region. Although feudalism had long fallen out of favour within the empire, the mountainous terrain and it’s people’s familiarity with combat in such terrain meant that any attempt to change the situation forcibly could result in open revolt that could take years to clear out and would attract many a dissident. In its eternal wisdom the church instead decided to leave these dukes alone for the most part and form a mutually beneficial relationship instead.

Within the duchy of Siona lies the county of Forind, and within Forind lies the barony of Zenndra. A small barony highly reliant on the income of its fairly large iron mines, a trade that has been booming ever since the food industry found out about canning.

The elven house of Pavet has long watched over the barony, as does its current head, Elduin Pavet. He and his wife Rania have had two daughters Sahiusa and [[Brighid]], as well as a son and heir Waris. Some of the extended family also lives and works in the barony.

Sahiusa was born with white faintly glowing freckles on her face, indicating she was not a normal elf. The church was called in and recognised it as a sign of an aasimar. This revelation, interesting as it was, initially meant little for Sahiusa. After a slightly rowdy childhood with her [[Brighid|sister]] she would soon develop a talent for writing, maths, riding and other such courtly activities.

At the age of 50 this calm life abruptly ended with the disappearance of her [[Brighid|sister]].
Her carriage suddenly disappeared and even though the efforts to find them went as far as receiving aid from the confederation and church alike, the search ended with no sign of any of the missing people. This loss hit Sahiusa hard. She had always been very close with her Brighid|sister and losing her was a stab in the heart. She became more and more distant, in her dreams she blamed herself for this loss, the shine on her freckles faded, the wings she had learned to call forth went from white to grey, her dreams became nightmares and the freckles and wings turned jet black. She had fallen.

Her father looked on with sorrow in his heart as he saw the loss of not one, but two of his daughters. He knew he would not be able to change the course his daughter had set, and so he had no choice but to send her to his lord, count Qinjor Kreivi, who would undoubtedly send her to one of the many facilities of the church in the east.

Qinjor was a Firbolg about three centuries old. His life and attunement to nature’s laws had given him a wisdom that would often cause surprising decisions. Rather than sentencing this girl to a life as one of many of the church’s inmates, he sentenced her to become one of his personal retainers. Though the delegation of the church present protested fiercely, they dared not interfere in this judgement.

Qinjor had heard and seen Sahiusa’s plight and decided what she needed was a purpose.
She was trained in the ways of the naginata and used her abilities to write and do maths to aid in the administration of the county.

Though the progress was slow, Sahiusa started to notice the nightmares changing. They became more infrequent and rather than being an observer she started to actively oppose what cruel fates they had in store for her and her family. Slowly but surely she regained her composure and her faith, resulting in her wings turning a dark shade of blue, like that of a raven.

This newfound faith was sorely tested during the elven revolt. Though the confederation stayed loyal to the church, many friends from both the barony and the county were sent to the frontline, and many did not come back. Sahiusa was put in charge of a squad of the count’s retinue focussed on home defence, and she would work closely with the regional scouts, hunters and others to make sure no rebel would find a foothold inside the county.

So it was that she would respond to a report of a rebel encampment in one of the many caves nearby. The rebel city of Millemel had fallen and many insurgents had searched for refuge in the mountainous landscape of the confederation. These insurgents were different however. They wore religious garbs and the sound of chanting could be heard. Thinking these might be pilgrims of some kind her squad approached the cave peacefully, a firebolt in their direction quickly changed their minds.

Although the fanatics fought fiercely enough to challenge even the church’s prestigious paladins in zeal, their lack of actual weaponry and armour meant they had lost before the fighting even started. as they went through the camp to capture any stragglers Sahiusa noticed one door was significantly sturdier. Likely the chapel of whatever foul religion they followed. she formed up a few of her squadmates behind her and steeled herself as she opened the door.

Behind it she found what could only be described as a monster, a girl with the horns of a devil, the scales of a lizard, the tail of a dragonborn, the wings of a dragon, malnourished, dim eyed and very much screaming in her direction, knocking Hanford straight off his feet.
After recovering from the initial shock she took a good look at the monster.

‘Brighid?’

A whirlwind of emotions raced through her as she approached what seemed to be her [[Brighid|sister]], it took all the restraint and every ounce of willpower her training had given her to remain calm. The rest of the squad quickly decided that they were needed in the other parts of the complex. When she approached further into the cell she could see a small glint of recognition within the eyes of the dragon girl, though if it was from seeing her or hearing her own name Sahiusa could not tell.

[[Brighid]] did not resist as Sahiusa wrapped her cloak around her and slowly carried her outside. The squad brought the captives to Qinjor for questioning and Sahiusa brought her sister to the castle’s infirmary, which was slightly confused whether they should take the treatment sets for elf or dragonborn.

Not long after the incident an inquisitor of the church arrived to observe this phenomenon one of the prisoners described as dream ascension and concluded that a cure was not within the church’s possession. The glare from Sahiusa after his suggestion to take her to the capital for research made him instead suggest a more hands off observation approach within Zenndra castle, though a few rather… loud incidents there whenever Sahiusa left [[Brighid|Brighid's]] side for longer times convinced everyone that they should stay together in Forind instead.

Over the years much progress has been made with [[Brighid]]. She can speak without blasting everyone (most of the time), she can sing at times and Sahiusa even noticed the occasional smile. However, she also noticed her little sister throwing worried glances at her and the sky at times, as if expecting something.

After the civil war was over multiple voyages were made to the island of [[The Island|Arcadia]].
One of these voyages was joined by Fenlamin, Qinjor’s son and heir.
Hoping to bring glory to his house’s name Fenlamin had even brought Forind’s feudal ring with him. This ring was formed out of a dream signifying Ashling herself wished for their family to govern these lands. Now both Fenlamin and the ring have gone missing, an unacceptable situation for Qinjor.

A new voyage is being sent out and a 70 year old Sahiusa has been tasked to retrieve both son and ring, alive or dead. The voyage itself however is aimed at finding proof of the light’s authority, and such proof is bound to help her [[Brighid|sister]] return to her former self, or so Sahiusa thinks.
