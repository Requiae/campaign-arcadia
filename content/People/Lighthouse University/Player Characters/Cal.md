## Backstory

Cal was created, as all their siblings were, by [[Headmaster Pharos]]. They don’t have many memories of being a living person, and attach little sentimentality to the fact they were once a person. After conversion, they spent their time in mandatory education, specializing themselves in engineering and the natural sciences. An important part of this was learning of all the Great People who contributed to scientific knowledge, and thanks to this Cal gained a deep reverence for the Ancestors.

However, Cal was never satisfied with book-learning. They had ambitions to apply their knowledge in the real world, and actually put in the work to rebuild the glorious Arcadian civilization they were always told about. However, most of their peers thought that it wasn’t time yet. They had a friend or two who was interested, but Cal didn’t have the leadership skills necessary to start a movement.

And so, at the start of our story Cal has resigned themselves to practical labor. Defending and repairing watchtowers that are attacked by wild animals. Chasing out old stray experiments hiding in the tunnels of the train network. They would even take it upon themselves to patrol the beaches, to have a chance at conversing with one of the newcomers before they lost their minds.

Waiting, and biding their time for their chance to change the world...
