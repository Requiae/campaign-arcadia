A simple kitchen knife, but in pristine condition. It has an enchanted crystal on the handle that holds its magic. It can be removed from the kitchen knife and reattached to a different weapon. If the crystal is removed, the kitchen knife's age quickly catches up with it.

The gem gives the weapon the following properties:

- The weapon is always clean.
- The holder may cast the Light and Dancing Lights cantrips.
- The holder may cast the Daylight spell. If they do, they can't do so again until the next dawn.
