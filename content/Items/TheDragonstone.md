#### (requires attunement)

This stone suddenly appeared. You are unsure where it came from.

The Dragonstone is an icosahedral ruby with a diameter of 5 cm. It floats in a tightly wound spiral mithril cage. The Dragonstone is warm to the touch. It shines a dim red light in a radius of 5 feet. When shaken or moved, the stone slightly trails the center of the cage, but it never touches the metal.

- When you hold the Dragonstone, you can speak, understand, and read draconic. When speaking draconic, you gain advantage on persuasion checks against other draconic speakers who are younger than you.

If you are attuned to the stone, it gains additional effects.

#### Commanding prowess

- You learn the Command spell and may cast it once per day for free.

#### Early flight

- As a bonus action or as a reaction, you gain a flying speed of 15 feet for 30 seconds. You must stand on the ground for at least 30 seconds between uses of this ability.
