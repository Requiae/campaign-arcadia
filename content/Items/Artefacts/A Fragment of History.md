#### (requires attunement)

This box was given to you by [[Headmaster Pharos]]. He has not explained its unique name to you.

A fragment of history is a dark wooden box engraved with angular spiral patterns, with corners made of gleaming ivory. On the inside, it is clad with a thick felt that's rough to the touch. It is 20 cm wide, 10 cm high and 15 cm deep.

Once per day anyone may cast a spell of 1st level or lower into this artifact to store it. The attuned person may cast that spell for free, and if the spell requires concentration A Fragment of History may concentrate on it for you. A Fragment of History can hold up to 3 levels of spell at the same time. At midnight during the night of the darkest moon, all spells in it are wiped.

If you are attuned to A Fragment of History, it gains additional effects.

#### The Gift of Transposition

- While you are attuned to A Fragment of history, only you may open or close it. If the box is closed and you speak its command word, the contents of the box are automatically transported to the lighthouse university campus.

#### Focused Recollection

- If a spell has a chance to go wrong for you, reduce that chance by 25%.
