A magical rod fashioned from precious metals and inscribed with Elven script. It is created and used by the people of [[Dur Ovdal]] to gain safer passage into the magically warped [[Arcadia City]].

The rod protects the bearer against the warping and corrupting magical energies found in Arcadia City. The rod slowly degrades on use and will last for a few hours to a day, depending on its quality.
