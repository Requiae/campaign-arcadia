#### (requires attunement)

This ring was formed in a dream, as a sign of legitimacy for the duke of Forind. It is said to give the bearer increased martial and diplomatic prowess.

Forind's Feudal Ring is made of gold. It is finely detailed to look like a series of hands grabbing each other's wrists to signify the unity of the duchies. It is inlaid with a bright blue topaz. When held up to the ear, the bristling of trees and the faraway singing of birds can be heard.

The ring has 3 charges, which it regains at dawn. At any time, you may spend a charge to gain advantage on your next charisma-based skill check.

If you are attuned to the ring, it gains additional effects. You may spend charges to do any of the following.

#### Combat versatility (1 charge)

As a bonus action, you may gain an additional fighting style for the next minute.

#### Third wind (2 charges)

As a bonus action, you regain your use of second wind. You may immediately use it for free.
