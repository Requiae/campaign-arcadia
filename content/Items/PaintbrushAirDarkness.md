#### (requires attunement)

This magical paintbrush was a gift to Haaron by the queen of the Unseelie court.

The handle of the Paintbrush of Air and Darkness is made of a poison oak variant native to the Unseelie court. The wood is dark and oily, uneven with multiple knots on the sides. The ferrule is made of bronze, and is inscribed with the sylvan sentence "peace through creation". The bristles are very thin and precise, and made of auburn elven hair. Attached to the brush with a long, thin bronze chain is a walnut-sized paint vial made of black glass. It is inscribed with the sylvan sentence "peace through subservience".

While holding the Paintbrush by its handle, the vial will magically float nearby you. It cannot move beyond the reach of the chain, which is 2 feet long. The vial holds 1 dollop of paint. You may use a bonus action to change the colour of the paint in the vial. The vial refills at dawn. Painting a 5x5 cm square takes approximately 1 dollop.

If you are attuned to the paintbrush, it will gain additional effects. The paintbrush is a spell casting focus for a warlock. You may spend one or more dollops of a colour to get its effect. The effects are described per colour.
