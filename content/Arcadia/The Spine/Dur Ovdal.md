## Culture

Dur Ovdal is the second oldest queendom, oldest still thriving, of [[The Island|Arcadia]]. The queendom has invested a lot in entertainment which ranges from sports to theatre and literature.

Their culinary progress is less advanced given that the queendom is located entirely underground and like all civilisations on Arcadia they rarely trade with others if at all. The have access to plants that can grow in low light conditions such as Serpentbloom, nuts brought in by certain species of burrowing animals, a large variety of mycelium. They also have some small expertise in husbandry, which is mostly based on rats as these can subsist on their resources and can handle the low light conditions.

Production wise the drow produce cloths from silk produced by their spiders and mycelia. They also use something called ironsilk instead of mortar.
