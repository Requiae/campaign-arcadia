A large [[Ancient Arcadia|Arcadian]] city on the far west of the island. It currently houses [[Hamon|Hamon Aeqenmar]] and his group of [[The Curse|Accursed]]. Most of the city is being maintained by automatons or falling apart. in the middle stands a large spire where a large concentration of magic is being siphoned and distributed by a mummified person conduit.
