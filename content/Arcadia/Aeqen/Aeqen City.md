A large Arcadian city on the far west of the island. It currently houses [[Hamon|Hamon Aeqenmar]] and his group of cursed. Most of the city is being maintained by automatons or falling apart. in the middle stands a large spire where a large concentration of magic is being siphoned and distributed by a mummified person conduit.
