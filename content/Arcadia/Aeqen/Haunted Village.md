The main village consists of eight houses surrounding a town square with a fountain. Six of those houses are larger and fancier buildings assumed to have been for administrators and overseers, and their families. And the smaller and less decorated ones are assumed to have been for workers. Towards the sea there are a few more worker houses, a large harbour, and a automated mussel farm tended to by an automaton the party refers to as Mr. Mussels.

The town's main purpose was to receive shipments from across the sea for the city of [[Arcadia/Aeqen/Aeqen|Aeqen]] back when it was still inhabited by [[Ancient Arcadia|Arcadians]].

The town was until recently cursed as it was haunted by the souls of those that wished to flee from the disaster would end the Arcadian civilisation. Most of these souls tried sail away but the ship capsized as it was struck by lightning. The curse was lifted by the [[Player-Character|last expedition]]
