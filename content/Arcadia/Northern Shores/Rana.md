The city of Rana lies on the northern shores of [[The Island|Arcadia]] and is governed by a large specimen of the frogfolk by the name of [[Iploosh|Archpriest Iploosh]]. It's location on the northern delta allows its population of frogfolk and fishfolk easy travel around the city, with sizeable parts of it built underwater. The city also houses a sizeable population of travellers from Lux who, with their minds wiped by the curse, are forced into manual labour.

Important locations include the temple complex, burnt harbour and market district. Defensive works include bridge checks, a crumbling wall, multiple river branches putting non aquatics at a disadvantage and an array of ballistas functioning as air defence.

The main rival of Rana are the goblins to the south, who use hot air balloons and explosive devices to wreak havoc on the city during their many raids.
