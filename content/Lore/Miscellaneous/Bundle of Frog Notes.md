> I beg of you, please, my men are revolting! You have to send more rations, we can't keep hunting _and_ digging _and_ overseeing the slaves. What kind of crap do they teach you in the logistics school.

> Some of the slaves have been talking among each other about some sort of "king of the swamps". Initially I thought this was great, until I figured they were not talking about the great [[Ipploosh|Archpriest Ipploosh]], who is obviously the king of the swamp, but about someone else. I've asked for some scouting parties to go find this king. Maybe he and Ipploosh can have a king-battle, and we can finally, formally become the leader of these swamps.

> There have been no more attacks from the goblins for a few days. I know not whether that means they are giving up or whether they are planning a real big strike soon. Regardless, I'm sure we can fight them off. After all, we have the finest warriors, and the best tactics, and no one will ever beat us.

> We have found some sort of burial site, and in it some strange crowns. Maybe magic? We continue the digging.

> I hate to do this by letter, but I fear I have been unfaithful. I find it hard to live with what I've done, and I find it unfair to you to stay silent. That's why I think it's best if we end our relationship. With this letter, I've sent you two month's rations that I've collected from the common pile, I hope those are enough to feed our little tadpoles Glampluk, Zpabluff, Driflink, Glarblik Jr., Zpaulded, Splirlup, Drundup, Zpaltiff, Zponk, Splas, Zompus, Glorlop, Glorlop II, Zops, Tauth, Zputh, Granpok, Drilbok, Trup, Glorlop III, Mibluff, and of course little Spliggluf through the winter. My sincerest apologies, and all my heart,

> Dear general Croaglof,

> What is the progress of finding the king of the swamp? Is he found yet? Has Archpriest Ipploosh fought him in a king-battle yet? Affirmation would really help morale around here.
