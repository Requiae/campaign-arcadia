The church of the Lantern has finally restored peace in the northern reaches of Lux, where it had fought a civil war no more than 10 years ago. However, this peace has come
at a price. The church no longer holds full religious authority over all its peoples, having
to concede that other people may worship local gods and spirits if they pay a small tax. In
an attempt to regain some of its legitimacy, it has sent many expeditions around the
world to find definitive proof of the truth of their story, and perhaps some forgotten
religious relics that were spread in the Great Expansion. It has sent your particular group
to the island of Arcadia, where it has also sent some previous expeditions that haven't
returned yet. Are you simply hellbent on Arcadia's exploration? Looking for glory, gold, or
some specific thing on the island? Are you an outcast looking for a reason to leave home
and find camaraderie on a crew? Or are you a dissident impressed by the church for
political reasons? Regardless, you embark to explore the place that no one has returned
from... yet.
